        <p>On Kim Asendorf:
Kim Asendorf is a code wrangler and an idea recycler and a posterchild of bad art. Unaesthetics being one of the chakras of the internet and Kim being one of it’s gurus. Coding being classically unromantic and institutionally uninspiring – visually – Kim presents his code as not just the hackmagic that produces his pieces, but also as having its own intrinsically appealing qualities. And also, he hasn’t coded very much at all. He doesn’t have an extensive github, none of his projects are integral parts of any other large undertakings (other than the internet zeitghost), and as far as I can tell his entire coding prowess is limited to Processing and HTML (maybe?). Despite this, within the tumblrspheres in which he’s known, he’s known for coding. So for me, Kim is inspiring not as a gleaming contributor to the programming community, but as an example of code culture appropriation and how to make code look sexy to the wider Internet.</p>
